Mediastinum and Lymph Nodes:  There is no pathologic adenopathy demonstrated in the axilla, mediastinum, or hilar regions. Heart and vascular structures: There is cardiomegaly. There is a cardiac pacemaker in place. There are small areas of atherosclerotic disease present, likely to include in the coronary arteries. There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta. There is no significant pericardial effusion. Esophagus and visualized portion of the gastrointestinal tract: There is a mildly dilated partially fluid-filled distal esophagus.
