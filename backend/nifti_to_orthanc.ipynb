There is a cardiac pacemaker in place. There are small areas of atherosclerotic disease present, likely to include in the coronary arteries. There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta. There is no significant pericardial effusion. Esophagus and visualized portion of the gastrointestinal tract: There is a mildly dilated partially fluid-filled distal esophagus. This could represent a hiatal hernia. Osseous structures and chest wall:  Unremarkable without acute or significant non-degenerative abnormalities. Visualized portion of the lower neck:  No major abnormalities are demonstrated in the portion of the neck included on this chest CT scan. Visualized portion of the upper abdomen:  There is ascites present with a small amount of fluid surrounding the liver and spleen. There is significant pulmonary fibrosis present, with large areas of honeycombing present involving both lower lung zones. There are milder areas of abnormality in the subpleural right greater than left upper lung zones. There are mild areas of groundglass opacity in the right upper lung zone, but there is no consolidation in the lungs. There are no suspicious pulmonary mass lesions. There are very small bilateral pleural effusions. There is at least mild ascites seen in the portion of the upper abdomen included on this exam.\"\n",
